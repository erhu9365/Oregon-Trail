The function is used whenever the player is required to solve a puzzle --> uses the random number generator 
to correctly guess the number between 1 and 10 with 3 attempts at their disposal
1. First sets the user's attempts to 0 and generates a randon number between 1 to 10
2. A while loop is used to iterate until the user uses up all 3 attempts
    - The player inputs a guess --> additional if statement and for loop is used to eliminate edge cases
    - Then, it checks if the input is the same as the random number --> if correct, tells the player they solved the puzzle and returns true,
    otherwise, it adds 1 to the user's attempts and tells them to try again
3. If the player uses up all 3 attempts, the while loop ends and tells them that they failed to solve the puzzle and returns false.
Parameters: None
Return: true or false

The function gives the user store information, displays the store menu, the user's current items and cost they want to buy. 
This function can also be used along different points of the journey. An constructor for the store is made so it keeps track
of the user's wanted items and once the user is done shopping, it adds whatever they wanted into their inventory
1. First, information about the store in a text file is read and get displays to the player
2. Once all variables are initalized, a while loop is set up to loop through the menu and current items until the user enters 0 to leave the store
- If user chooses 1, the user can buy oxens and inputs the amount they want (goes through statements for edge cases) and checks if
the user has enough money to purchase oxens. There is also a certain amount of oxens the user has to buy as well.
- If user chooses 2, the user can buy food and inputs the amount they want (goes through statements for edge cases) and checks if
the user has enough money to purchase food. There is also a recommended amount for users to buy.
- If user chooses 3, the user can buy box of bullets and inputs the amount they want (goes through statements for edge cases) and checks if
the user has enough money to purchase bullets. The user buys based on the number of boxes
- If user chooses 4, the user can buy wagons parts and medkits and inputs the amount they want (goes through statements for edge cases) and checks if
the user has enough money to purchase wagon parts and medkits. 
3. The screen is cleared for the next stage of the game and saves the user's item into the Traveler object ot the user
Parameters: the Traveler object of the player and the Traveler object of the store
Return: the Traveler object of the player

1. First option: The player runs away and loses an ox, 10 lbs of food, and a wagon part
2. Second option: The player attack the raiders, either winning or losing the fight
- if the player wins, they receive 50 lbs of food and 50 bullets

The function allows the player to go through a 2 week turn, traveling between 70 and 140 miles. It also allows the player to

1. Sets the date two weeks in advance, how much the player traveled between 70 and 140 miles, and decrease the amount of food (3 lbs) within the 2 weeks
2. Determines if the player reaches a landmark and what kind of landmark they are at
- If it is a regular landmark, the user can either wait or continue on
- If it is a river, the user can either wait or continue on
- If it is a fort, the user can either wait, visit the store, or continue on
- Once the landmark is reached, the landmark arrays increase by one

/*
The function gives the player a chance to hunt to randomly encounter an animal and solve a puzzle in order to successfully
hunt the animal (each animal gives different amount of food). The player also gets to choose how well each person wants to eat for the given day.
1. Random odds are generated for each different type of animal to determine which animal will be encountered
2. Depending of the odds works in favor of the player, the player decides whether they want to hunt the animal(s) or not
3. Then, the function determines if the player has enough bullets to hunt
- if so, they need to solve a puzzle in order to successfuly hunt the animal
- Depending on the animal and the player wins, they receive a certain amount of food. Otherwise, notifies the player that the hunt is unsuccessful
4. If the player has successfully hunted for food, they are asked how well they want to eat for the day
5. Checks if the total amount of food is more than 1000. If so, the player leaves behind extra food.
6. The date increases by 1 date and returns the Traveler object of the player
Parameters: the Traveler object of the player
Return: the Traveler object of the player
