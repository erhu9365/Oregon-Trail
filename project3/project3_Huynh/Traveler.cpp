The constructor is used to get information on the group and what date they would like to start on.
1. The user inputs the name of the leader along with the companions
2. The user is asked if they want to start on the default date or on another date in a specificed range --> creates time object
3. Then the milestone object is created, balance of group, and and miles
4. The necessary materials are also created and set.
